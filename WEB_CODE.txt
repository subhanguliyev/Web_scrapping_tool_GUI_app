 Whether you're packing light for a holiday, bringing the essentials for an overnight stay at a friend's or are going on a several day camping trip, being able to pack your clothing into your bag correctly can save you lots of space. You can use packing cubes to help alleviate the storing process, but even without specialized products, with a bit of thought you can pack your bag efficiently, intelligently and conveniently so that you won't have to stress when it comes to unpacking.

 Clothes can take up a lot of space in your backpack, but by using the army rolling technique, you can store them more efficiently. To roll t-shirts, start by laying them flat on a surface and fold the left side into the center. Fold the sleeve back on itself, then do the same with the other side. Once you’ve folded both sides, fold the t-shirt vertically and roll it into a tight bundle. Use a similar technique to roll your underwear and roll your socks into balls too. If you’re packing shoes, fit your underwear and socks inside them to save space. Instead of rolling pants, fold the legs together, then fold them in half horizontally twice. When you’re packing your clothes into your bag, put light items, like t-shirts, at the bottom of the bag so heavier items will squash them down.
